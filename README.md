# Data Analysis – Housing Projects

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a housing dataset to understand how property characteristics influence home prices. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that affect selling prices and comparing market selling prices with appraised values.

This project is designed as a **portfolio ready data analysis case study** using **Excel / Python concepts**, suitable for recruiters and hiring managers.

## 📂 Dataset Description

**File:** `Project 1.xlsx`
The dataset contains **148 housing records** with the following variables:
| Column Name     | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| House           | Unique house identifier                 |
| Selling Price   | Final market selling price of the house |
| Appraised Value | Estimated value determined by appraisal |
| Square Feet     | Total living area (in sq. ft.)          |
| Bedrooms        | Number of bedrooms                      |
| Bathrooms       | Number of bathrooms                     |

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze factors influencing housing selling prices
* Compare selling price vs appraised value
* Understand the impact of house size and rooms on price
* Identify patterns and trends in residential real estate data

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Verified dataset for missing values
* Ensured correct data types for numerical columns
* Checked for outliers and unrealistic values
* Renamed columns for clarity where needed

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analysis performed:

### 1. Price Analysis

* Distribution of selling prices across all houses
* Comparison between **Selling Price** and **Appraised Value**
* Identification of underpriced and overpriced properties

### 2. Size vs Price Relationship

* Relationship between **Square Feet** and **Selling Price**
* Larger homes generally command higher selling prices

### 3. Bedrooms & Bathrooms Impact

* Analysis of how the number of bedrooms affects price
* Bathrooms showed a stronger correlation with price than bedrooms

### 4. Appraisal Accuracy

* Calculated differences between selling price and appraised value
* Identified cases where market value exceeded appraisal estimates
## 📈 Key Insights

* **Square footage is the strongest driver** of selling price
* Houses with more bathrooms tend to sell for higher prices
* Appraised values are generally close to selling prices but not always accurate
* Some smaller homes sell above appraisal due to market demand

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Microsoft Excel** (Data storage & initial exploration)
* **Python (planned extension)** for visualization and modeling
* **GitHub** for version control and project hosting
